Ideas for this robot
Motion sensor
Robot that has buttons on the bottom
Will have game built into it, lights, speaker, and pattern recognition

Robot’s Mechanics
Game of clicking a button x times and the robot flashes x times.
Opening of compartments after completing a puzzle
Light flashing in certain patterns due to button pressing.

Robot’s Structure
Box containing 4 different compartments
Control Panel containing buttons ABC and Switches 123.
Controlled by 4 servos
1x arduino board


Robot’s Mechanic’s
Robot will have a series of circuits to perform in order for the hatch to open.
If the circuits are completed, the capsule will open and the rocket will have a light feeded through and flicker to emulate takeoff.
Series of games like matching the speed of the light flickering with light
Gaining parts to create electromagnet to use to solve box’s last puzzle
If game is not done within 5 minutes, the game will restart, having an explosion sound when time runs out

Robot’s Boxes
Box 1: contains a nail and copper wire, also holds clue/riddle
Combination: Button A & B: 12 AND clicks (first click A to enable B, then click B to make AND circuit / SW1: On.
Flashing of LED 2 & 4 light to be done 5 times after completing other steps using loops.
Clue 1: “Use your items to create the tool.”
Box 2: contains 9V battery along with clue/riddle
Combination: Buttons B = 11 & C = 38 clicks / Switch 2 = 5 flicks on/off.
LED 1, 3, and 5 all on.
Clue 2: “What does this gadget do for your journey knowing there's gold on the other side?”
Box 3: contains a servo on a metal plate that will be brought up by the electromagnet by sliding it next to the wall, sliding the servo up and then completing the puzzle.
Combination: Completing a servo code to open the box
turn LED 2 & 6 on once and then back off.  
Switch 1 and 3 will be used to create a NOR circuit.
Song will play for completion and timer will stop.
