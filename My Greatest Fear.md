My greatest fear in life would be not conquoring what I set out to do or something that I believe I can achieve. I dread the thought of not seeing how far 
I can go in a certin area that im highly interested in, especially if it also has meaning towards me. An example of this would be preforming well on a test
that I studied for, but not getting 100%. Although I may of got a 95% or 85%, I still believe that I could've got a 100%. That's what I strive for every 
time I am on a new task for myslef. I always set high goals for myself because of what it offers to me and my position in life. belief comes from me 
studying for 4 hours a day for 5 days strait in preparation for a path test, and getting a 100%. It meant so much to me I screamed and jumped for joy, 
and I long for that feeling of acomplishment and relief every time I fix my mid on a goal. This is also true for my goals in the future after high school,
I want to excell and build myself financially, athletically, and spiritually.
